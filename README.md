**About**

For our final project at the Northcoders bootcamp, we created an online game. A take on the classic Guess Who, but with the twist that rather than people, you're guessing the alien.

Here is a short video regarding the game:

During the planning phase it was agreed that the single player game would be the MVP, which is what we aimed for.

Once this was achieved, we moved on to creating a two player version. We needed to use websockets for the multiplayer aspect, so for this socket.io was used.

**Tech Stack**

Node.js, Express.js, Axios, MongoDB, Jest, Next.js, Socket.io
